# DRIBD@

### A [Data Cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cooperative) with a focus on [performance measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_measurement), established to collectively manage data of, and derive added value from, evidence of personal and shared engagement.

This is especially relevant, but not limited to, knowledge work, accreditation steps, and volunteering done outside of your home or workplace. We are inspired by athletic performance, where keeping personal and collective statistics is a well established practice. Yet it is concerning to us when human performance data is misappropriated for targeted advertisement, manipulative personnel management or recruitment, misleading analysis or automated decisions with questionable ethics.

[Open platforms](https://dribdat.cc) should benefit all people, supporting the communities that form around hackathons, timebanking, coworking, repair caf√©s, open source projects, and other new modes of working. The basic purpose of the cooperative is to maintain, develop, and educate people in their application.
