# DRIBD

> A [Data Cooperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cooperative) with a focus on [performance measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_measurement). 

### DRIBD has been established to collectively manage data of, and derive added value from, evidence of personal and shared engagement.

This is especially relevant, but not limited to, knowledge work, accreditation steps, and volunteering done outside of your home or workplace. 

It is concerning when such data is misappropriated for targeted advertisement, manipulative personnel management or recruitment, misleading analysis, etc.

We can be inspired by athletic performance, where keeping personal and collective statistics is a well established practice. 

Our open platforms should benefit communities that form around hackathons, timebanking, coworking, repair cafés, open source projects, and other new modes of working.
